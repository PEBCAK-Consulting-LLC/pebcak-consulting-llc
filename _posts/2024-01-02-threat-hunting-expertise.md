Over the past decade, I've had the privilege of working across the threat hunting landscape - from endpoint security at Carbon Black to cloud security at AWS. Here's what I've learned about the evolution of threat hunting.

## The Journey

My threat hunting journey began in traditional endpoint security, where we focused on:
- Behavioral analysis of malware
- Lateral movement detection
- Ransomware investigation techniques

## Key Publications & Research

Some highlights from my research and writing:

### Co-Authored Huntpedia
The [Huntpedia](https://www.threathunting.net/files/huntpedia.pdf) serves as a comprehensive guide for threat hunters, covering methodologies and best practices I've developed over years of hands-on experience.

### Carbon Black Blog Series
During my time at Carbon Black, I authored numerous articles on:
- Ransomware analysis and mitigation
- Point-of-sale malware investigations  
- Bitcoin mining malware detection
- SSL/TLS security considerations

## Speaking at Scale

From local meetups to international conferences like DerbyCon and SANS summits, I've shared insights on:
- **Lateral Movement Detection** - My DerbyCon 2017 presentation on hunting for lateral movement
- **Cloud Threat Hunting** - Adapting traditional hunting techniques for cloud environments
- **Security Testing** - "Doing Bad Things for Good Reasons" at SANS CloudSecNext

## The Cloud Evolution

Moving to AWS has opened new frontiers in threat hunting:
- Cloud-native detection techniques
- Serverless security considerations
- API-driven security automation

## What's Next

The field continues to evolve with AI/ML integration and cloud-first architectures. Stay tuned for more insights on these emerging areas.
