# GitHub Pages Blog Setup Questions

Based on your current repository structure, here are the key questions you need to answer before configuring your repository for GitHub Pages:

## Technical Configuration Questions

1. **Static Site Generator Choice**
   - Do you want to use Jekyll (GitHub's default), Hugo, 11ty, Gatsby, or plain HTML/CSS/JS?
   - Jekyll is the easiest since GitHub Pages has built-in support

2. **Repository Structure**
   - Do you want to use the `main` branch or create a dedicated `gh-pages` branch?
   - Will you build from the root directory or a `/docs` folder?

3. **Domain Configuration**
